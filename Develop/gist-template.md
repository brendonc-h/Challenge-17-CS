# Title (replace with your title)

For this week's challenge we're going to be explaing how a regex (regular expression) function works. I'm going to be explaing how a Hex Value function works. This is the function (/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/).

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchor: ^
The Code Snippet: `/^#`

Description:
Anchors don't match any regular expression. Rather they assert something about the string based on expressions/matching pattern next to the anchor.

Example: `^This` indicates that the string must begin with `This`

The ^ is an anchor that indicates that the beginning of the string must match the character #. # is used to distinguish a hexadecimal number from a decimal number. However, as we will see in the next anchor, # is optional.

Anchor: $

Code Snippet: `$/`

Description: Matches the end of the string. Similar to the ^ anchor, $ is used to check if a string fully matches a pattern. However, $ asserts the pattern to theend of the string, not the beginning.

Example: `end$` indicates that the string must end with `end`.

In our case end of string must match with the 3 or 6 character pattern identified before the $ anchor. The 3 or 6 character patter is described in more detail under Qualifiers.
